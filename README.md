# Flavour-Hub
An app that enables people who like to cook / are learning to cook to discover new recipes, along with the associated nutritional information.

## Description

This project fullfils the criteria of building a browser application that enables users to discover new recipes, along with specific ingredient nutritional information where desired. It features a clean and responsive user interface and utilises HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

Flavour-Hub makes use of two APIs: Spoonacular (https://spoonacular.com/food-api) and Edamam (https://developer.edamam.com/food-database-api).

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Access the deployed application at the following URL: https://kbearne.github.io/Flavour-Hub

This application runs in the browser and allows a user to search for recipes via a search bar as well as discover recipes via highlighted content on the main page of the site (via an aesthetically pleasing user interface). The user search history persists when the browser is refreshed (by utilising local storage).

Once a user loads a recipe, detailed instructions for preparing the recipe are displayed along with the associated ingredients. 

If a user would like to know further nutritional information about a particular recipe ingredient then they can tick a checkbox next to an ingredient which will load calorie, total weight and diet label information.
